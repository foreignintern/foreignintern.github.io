## Few words about the author

Hey folks! I am a Computer Science graduate from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee. Currently, I am a Deep Learning Intern at Ambient.AI (Palo Alto, USA) and I am passionate about Machine learning research. In the past, I have carried out fully funded foreign internships at Purdue University (USA) and Kyoto University (Japan) in 2015 and 2016 respectively. More recently, I have received several internship offers in the AI/ML industry such as Zalando Research (Germany), 3D Media Co. (Japan), and Sentiance (Belgium). As a result, over the years I have gained a great experience in successfully applying for various kinds of foreign internships. 

Thus through the medium of this blog I would like to share the things that I have learned from my experiences and the advice I have for all the enthusiastic students out there! :)
